Title: Infinite Loop in Advdenturer card function

Product: dominion.c file from Matt Garner's assignment-2 branch of
GitHub repository

Classification: Serious Bug

Platform: OSU Engineering Server Flip3 with shell set TCSH accessed remotely 
using native SSH client on Mac OS Version 10.9.5

Can it be reproduced? Yes, occasionally.

*** Description ***
# Summary:
While testing the dominion.c Adventurer card function using randomized inputs, 
the random test function spotted behavior that would indicate an infinite 
loop had occurred with acceptable inputs.

# What happened:
The random testing function runs the Adventurer card function using randomized 
inputs within valid ranges. The test function indicated that an infinite loop 
occurred within the while loop of the Adventurer card function 5 times during 
testing.

# What's the error:
Under no conditions, with valid inputs, should the Adventurer card function
produce an infinite loop.

# Supporting Information:
This appears to happen when there are fewer than 2 treasure cards available
in the deck and discard piles.

*** Steps to Reproduce ***
Run Adventurer() card function with less than 2 treasure cards available in the
deck and discard piles.

*** Expected Results ***
Running the Adventurer() card function returns after searching through all available 
cards to draw even if two treasure cards are not found.

*** Actual Results ***
Running the Adventurer() card function with with fewer than 2 treasure cards
available to be drawn, produces an infinite loop. 

*** Workaround ***
Don't run Adventurer() card function unless at least 2 treasures are know to be in
the deck and discard piles

Title: Incorrect number of cards drawn using Smithy() card function

Product: dominion.c file from Matt Garner's assignment 2 branch

Classification: Serious Bug

Platform: OSU Engineering Server Flip3 with shell set TCSH accessed remotely 
using native SSH client on Mac OS Version 10.9.5

Can it be reproduced? Yes, every time.

*** Description ***
# Summary: 
Running unit test for Smithy() card function causes incorrect number of 
cards to be drawn every time it is played.

# What happened:
The unit test indicated that the number of cards drawn did not match the
number of cards expected to be drawn.

# What's the error:
The number of cards drawn should match the expected behavior of the Smithy(), 
but it does not.

# Supporting Information:
It appears that too many cards are being drawn rather than too few.

*** Steps to Reproduce ***
Copy state of player before playing Smithy() card and compare that to the 
player's state after playing the Smithy() card.

*** Expected Results ***
Expected 3 cards to be drawn from the current player's deck and added to their 
hand.

*** Actual Results ***
More than 3 cards were drawn from the current player's deck and added to their 
hand.

*** Workaround ***
Don't use Smithy card when playing Dominion.
